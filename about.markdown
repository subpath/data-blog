Hey! My name is Alex and I love Data Science.
This blog is a place where I can't dump my ideas and past experience. I'm always open to interesting proposals and collaborations.  You can find my latest CV on my Linkedin page.

All posts are made with Creative Commons license. Feel free to share it whenever you like. Would be cool if you would also reference me : )  

Cheers!
