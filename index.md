<br>
Hey! My name is Alex and I love Machine Learning and Data Science.

This blog is a place where I can dump my ideas and past experiences. 

I'm always open to interesting proposals and collaborations.  You can find my latest CV [here]({{ site.url }}/resume) or on my [Linkedin page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aosipenko/).

All posts are made with a Creative Commons license. Feel free to share it whenever you like. It would be fantastic if you would also reference me :)  

Cheers!
